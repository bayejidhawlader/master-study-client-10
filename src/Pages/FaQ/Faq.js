        <p>Saves time ?</p>
        <p>
          This reason might be the most obvious, but it’s a clear benefit of an
          FAQ page. Not only does the FAQ page save customers time, but it also
          saves employees time as well. Having an FAQ page ensures customers
          dont have to sit on the phone for hours waiting for simple answers and
          employees don’t have to individually answer all questions. Companies
          dedicate a large portion of their budgets to customer service teams.
          When these teams dont have to focus on answering the frequently asked
          questions, they can serve other customer issues in a more timely
          manner

        <p>
          If you are new to online learning, we recommend that you begin with
          one course. As our courses are offered frequently throughout the year,
          you can always come back and continue your studies with one or more
          topics.
