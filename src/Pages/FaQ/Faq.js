        <p>How do I select a course?</p>
        <p>
          Visit the course catalog to browse our offerings. In addition to
          searching by course duration and availability, you can also search by
          subject to ensure you find a course that reflects your interests.
          Though it is not required, we encourage those who have not studied art
          before to consider taking an art history course first to get a solid
          grounding in the discipline before exploring more specific
          disciplines. Our art history courses are the perfect first step before
          moving on to art market courses.

        <p>
          If you are new to online learning, we recommend that you begin with
          one course. As our courses are offered frequently throughout the year,
          you can always come back and continue your studies with one or more
          topics.
